# SRF (Structured Recomputation Framework) Variants

The `srf/` directory contains structured recomputation variants of the core algorithms.

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for future implementations that explore recomputation-based strategies.

## Design Philosophy
- **Recomputation Focus:** Each variant focuses on a specific recomputation strategy.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Future research will evaluate these variants against the baselines in `baselines/`.
- **Phase 2 and Beyond:** This directory will be populated as the research project progresses.
